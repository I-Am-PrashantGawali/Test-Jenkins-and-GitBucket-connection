# Test-Jenkins-and-GitBucket-connection
 To test the connection between Jenkins and GitBucket using GitHub as a reference, you first need to ensure that both Jenkins and GitBucket are installed and running. Start by creating a new repository in GitBucket, then clone this repository locally, add some files or a sample project, and push your changes back to GitBucket.
